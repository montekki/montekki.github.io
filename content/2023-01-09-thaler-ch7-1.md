Chapter three dives into a first Succinct Argument of Circuit 
Satisfiability. It does so by introducing what it calls a Relaxed
Polynomial Commitment Scheme that combines Merkle Trees and
Low-Degree tests. Implementing a first Succinct Argument sounds
like an interesting challenge, let's find out.

<!-- more -->

In Chapter 7 The Books gives the main definitions and the motivations
for the new objects called Polynomial Commitment Schemes. Essentially
what we want is a scheme where $\mathcal{P}$ would "commit" to
the evaluations of some polynomial and its degree to be later tested
by $\mathcal{V}$.


## The Scheme

The Scheme itself as it is quoting The Book:

> Let $\tilde{w} : \mathbb{F}^{\log n} \rightarrow \mathbb{F}$ be a
> ($\log n$)-variate multilinear polynomial over $\mathbb{F}$.
>
> Let $s$ be the string consisting of all $|\mathbb{F}|^{\log n}$
> evaluations of $\tilde{w}$.
>
> One obtains a polynomial commitment scheme by applying a Merkle-tree
> based string commitment scheme to $s$ and then applying a low-degree
> test to $s$.

Let's try to decompose it.

### Merkelizing the Evaluations

This is the easier part. Suppose for example that we have a function
$\mathbb{F_5}^2$. The evaluation table for this function would look
as follows:

| 0 0 | 0 1 | 0 2 | .. | 5 4 | 5 5 |
|-----|-----|-----|----|-----|-----|
| s[0]| s[1]| s[2]| .. |s[23]|s[24]|

And in order for $\mathcal{P}$ to commit to all the evaluations of
this function it needs to create a Merkle Tree of $s$ and send
$\mathcal{V}$ the root of this tree. Later when $\mathcal{V}$ asks
$\mathcal{P}$ to reveal any of the evaluations, $\mathcal{P}$ replies
with the evaluation + a proof of this evaluation's inclusion into the
tree. Since merkelizing things is such a common theme in the blockchain
space I am not going to go into it any further.

### Running a Low-Degree Test

The explanation from The Book is a bit handwavy so it probably makes
sense to look into [AS03] paper:

The low degree test is presented with
$f:\mathbb{F}^m \rightarrow \mathbb{F}$ and an integer $d$. It is also
presented a table that is meant to be "proof" that $f$ is degree $d$
polynomial. This table contains for each line in $\mathbb{F}^m$ a
univariate degree $d$ polynomial that supposedly describes restriction
of $f$ to that line. We will use the term $\textit{d-oracle}$ for any table that
contains, for each line in $\mathbb{F}^m$ a univariate degree $d$
polynomial.

$$
\boxed{
\begin{aligned}
&\text{\bf{The Low Degree Test:}}\cr
&\text{Pick a random line } l \text{ in } \mathbb{F}^m\cr
&\text{and read the univariate polynomial, say } p_l(t)\cr
&\text{which the given \textit{d-oracle} contains for this line.}\cr
&\text{Randomly pick a point $x$ on line $l$ and check}\cr
&\text{whether $p_l$ correctly describes $f$ at $x$.}\cr
&\text{If so, ACCEPT, else REJECT}
\end{aligned}
}
$$

The Test from the paper [AS03] is not interactive, and assumes the oracle
access to the whole $\textit{d-oracle}$ table. So here are a few ideas
to take this description to the PCS protocol from The Book:

1. At the beginning of the protocol $\mathcal{P}$ commits to the Merkle
tree of the string of $f$ evaluations and to the claimed degree $d$
of $f$ by sending these values to $\mathcal{V}$.
1. $\mathcal{V}$ picks a random line $l$ in $\mathbb{F}^m$ and sends
it to $\mathcal{P}$.
1. $\mathcal{P}$ replies with a univariate polynomial $p_l$ which
it claims to be a restriction of $f$ to $l$.
1. $\mathcal{V}$ generates a random $x \in \mathbb{F}$. Then it
evaluates line $l$ on $x$ to obtain a point in $\mathbb{F}^m$.
$\mathcal{V}$ sends this point to $\mathcal{P}$ and $\mathcal{P}$
replies with a corresponding value from $s$ and with the proof this
evaluation's membership in the Merkle tree which was previously
committed to by $\mathcal{P}$.
1. $\mathcal{V}$ checks that $p_l(x)$ equals the received value from $s$
and that this value belongs to the Merkle tree.

## Implementation

Restricting a polynomial to a line has been described and implemented
in a [previous post on GKR](@/2022-12-06-thaler-ch4-4.md). What
we need is the machinery to merkelize the evaluations string $s$.


### All Values of $\mathbb{F}$

First we need to be able to evaluate our function $f$ on all values in $\mathbb{F}^m$.
It would be great to introduce a helper trait that would allow the code to iterate
over all possible values of $\mathbb{F}$:

```rust
/// Iterate over all possible values of a finite field.
pub trait IF: Field {
    type Values: IntoIterator<Item = Self>;

    fn all_values() -> Self::Values;
}
```

Now in order to turn all values in $\mathbb{F}$ into all values in $\mathbb{F}^m$
we need to build all permutations of values in $\mathbb{F}$ of length $m$. Since building
such permutations is not the topic of this post the readily available code can be used to
extend the above trait with a helper function:


```rust
pub trait IF: Field {
    type Values: IntoIterator<Item = Self>;

    fn all_values() -> Self::Values;

    fn all_multidimentional_values(m: usize) -> Vec<Vec<Self>> {
        let mut res: Vec<_> =
            permutations::permutations(&Self::all_values().into_iter().collect::<Vec<_>>(), m)
                .collect();
        res.sort();
        res
    }
}
```

### Prover

$\mathcal{P}$ is initialized with some polynomial $f$, our implementation as usual
is going to be quite generic. Here, it is being generic over a field $\mathbb{F}$,
the $f$ and the parameters of the Merkle tree:

```rust
pub struct Prover<F: Field, M: MultilinearExtension<F>, P: Config<Leaf = F>> {
    tree: MerkleTree<P>,
    values_convenience_map: HashMap<Vec<F>, usize>,
    poly: M,
    values: Vec<F>,
}
```

The implementation allows any `MerkleTree` configuration to be used with only
restriction that the leafs of the tree have to be elements in $\mathbb{F}$.
Also `Prover` holds a convenience map from $\mathbb{F}^m$ to indices in the
evaluations string $s$.

Now to create a new $\mathcal{P}$ and populate all the fields in the above struct
a fairly involved logic has to be implemented:


```rust
impl<F: IF, M: MultilinearExtension<F>, P: Config<Leaf = F>> Prover<F, M, P> {
    /// Create a new Prover.
    pub fn new(
        poly: M,
        leaf_chr_params: <<P as Config>::LeafHash as CRHScheme>::Parameters,
        two_to_one_params: <<P as Config>::TwoToOneHash as TwoToOneCRHScheme>::Parameters,
    ) -> Result<Self> {
        let all_values = F::all_multidimentional_values(poly.num_vars());
        // Populate s
        let all_poly_values: Result<Vec<_>> = all_values
            .iter()
            .map(|value| poly.evaluate(value).ok_or(Error::PolyEvalDimMismatch))
            .collect();

        let all_poly_values = all_poly_values?;

        // Length of array for `MerkleTree` has to be a power of two, so
        // extend s with zeros up to that length.
        let all_values_len = all_poly_values.len();
        let values: Vec<_> = all_poly_values
            .iter()
            .cloned()
            .chain((all_values_len..all_values_len.next_power_of_two()).map(|_| F::zero()))
            .collect();

        // Build a convenience indexing map
        let values_convenience_map = all_values
            .iter()
            .enumerate()
            .map(|(i, value)| (value.clone(), i))
            .collect();

        // Build a MerkleTree.
        let tree: MerkleTree<P> =
            MerkleTree::new(&leaf_chr_params, &two_to_one_params, values.clone())?;

        Ok(Self {
            tree,
            poly,
            values_convenience_map,
            values,
        })
    }

}
```

To complete the implementation of $\mathcal{P}$ three functions have to be added:

```rust
    /// Get the merkle root.
    pub fn merkle_root(&self) -> P::InnerDigest {
        self.tree.root()
    }

    /// Restrict to line.
    pub fn poly_restriction_to_line(&self, b: &[F], c: &[F]) -> univariate::SparsePolynomial<F> {
        restrict_poly(b, c, &self.poly)
    }

    /// Challenge
    pub fn challenge(&self, point: Vec<F>) -> Result<(Path<P>, F)> {
        let point_index = self.values_convenience_map.get(&point).unwrap();
        Ok((
            self.tree.generate_proof(*point_index)?,
            self.values[*point_index],
        ))
    }
```

First one returns the root of the Merkle tree of $s$ $\mathcal{P}$ commits to at
the beginning of the protocol.

The second one restricts committed $f$ to a random line $x$ picked by $\mathcal{V}$.

The third one answers $\mathcal{V}$'s request to revel $s$ value at a given point
along with the proof of this value's membership in the committed Merkle tree.

### Verifier

The $\mathcal{V}$ is going to hold quite a lot of data:

```rust
/// The Verifier in the Relaxed PCS protocol.
pub struct Verifier<F: Field, P: Config<Leaf = F>> {
    x: F,
    degree: usize,
    challenge_point: Vec<F>,
    line: Vec<univariate::SparsePolynomial<F>>,
    num_vars: usize,
    prover_univariate: Option<univariate::SparsePolynomial<F>>,
    merkle_root: P::InnerDigest,
    leaf_chr_params: LeafParam<P>,
    two_to_one_params: TwoToOneParam<P>,
}
```

When a new $\mathcal{V}$ is created it has to be initialized with the
values of degree $d$ and the root of the Merkle Tree of $s$ $\mathcal{P}$ has committed to:

```rust
impl<F: Field, P: Config<Leaf = F>> Verifier<F, P> {
    /// Create a new Verifier.
    pub fn new(
        num_vars: usize,
        degree: usize,
        merkle_root: P::InnerDigest,
        leaf_chr_params: <<P as Config>::LeafHash as CRHScheme>::Parameters,
        two_to_one_params: <<P as Config>::TwoToOneHash as TwoToOneCRHScheme>::Parameters,
    ) -> Self {
```

Then it picks the random line in $\mathbb{F}^m$ to send it to the $\mathcal{P}$.
To do so $\mathcal{V}$ generates two random points in $\mathbb{F}^m$ and uses the
function `line` implemented earlier for the GKR protocol:

```rust
    pub fn random_line<R: Rng>(&mut self, rng: &mut R) -> (Vec<F>, Vec<F>) {
        let b: Vec<F> = (0..self.num_vars).map(|_| F::rand(rng)).collect();
        let c: Vec<F> = (0..self.num_vars).map(|_| F::rand(rng)).collect();
        self.line = line(&b, &c);
        (b, c)
    }
```

When $\mathcal{P}$ has sent a univariate polynomial $p_l$ claimed to be a restriction
of $f$ to the line generated earlier, $\mathcal{V}$ checks its degree and saves to
evaluate it later:

```rust
    pub fn committed_univariate(&mut self, p: univariate::SparsePolynomial<F>) -> Result<()> {
        if p.degree() > self.degree {
            return Err(Error::DegreeMismatch);
        }
        self.prover_univariate = Some(p);
        Ok(())
    }
```

Then $\mathcal{V}$ needs to pick a random point along the picked line $l$ and send it
to $\mathcal{P}$ querying the corresponding value in $s$ along with the proof:

```rust
    /// Challenge the prover at some point.
    pub fn challenge_prover<R: Rng>(&mut self, rng: &mut R) -> Vec<F> {
        self.x = F::rand(rng);
        self.challenge_point = self
            .line
            .iter()
            .map(|poly| poly.evaluate(&self.x))
            .collect();
        self.challenge_point.clone()
    }
```

Finally the $\mathcal{P}$'s reply has to be verified against the earlier
committed root of Merkle Tree of $f$ and also $\mathcal{V}$ needs to check
that value from $s$ $\mathcal{P}$ has replied with equals $p_l(x)$:

```rust
    /// Verify the prover's reply.
    pub fn verify_prover_reply(&self, path: Path<P>, leaf: F) -> Result<()> {
        path.verify(
            &self.leaf_chr_params,
            &self.two_to_one_params,
            &self.merkle_root,
            leaf,
        )?;

        let eval = self
            .prover_univariate
            .as_ref()
            .ok_or(Error::NoProverPoly)?
            .evaluate(&self.x);
        if leaf != eval {
            return Err(Error::EvalMismatch(
                format!("{:?}", leaf),
                format!("{:?}", eval),
            ));
        }
        Ok(())
    }
```

### Testing

The testing code configures the Merkle Trees the same way testing code in
[`ark-crypto-primitives`](https://github.com/arkworks-rs/crypto-primitives/blob/release-0.4/src/merkle_tree/tests/mod.rs)
does with the only exception is that the implementation of `Config` is generic
over field $\mathbb{F}$ and uses a wrapper for a hasher to go from this generic
field type to bytes for hash convenience:

```rust
    type LeafH = pedersen::CRH<JubJub, Window4x256>;
    struct CHROverField<F> {
        __f: PhantomData<F>,
    }

    impl<F: Field> CRHScheme for CHROverField<F> {
        type Input = F;

        type Output = <LeafH as CRHScheme>::Output;

        type Parameters = <LeafH as CRHScheme>::Parameters;

        fn setup<R: Rng>(
            r: &mut R,
        ) -> std::result::Result<Self::Parameters, ark_crypto_primitives::Error> {
            LeafH::setup(r)
        }

        fn evaluate<T: Borrow<Self::Input>>(
            parameters: &Self::Parameters,
            input: T,
        ) -> std::result::Result<Self::Output, ark_crypto_primitives::Error> {
            let bytes = to_uncompressed_bytes!(input).map_err(|_| Box::new(Error::ToBytesError))?;
            LeafH::evaluate(parameters, bytes.as_ref())
        }
    }
```

This way in the config for the merkle tree the associated `Leaf` type can be our field
and not the `[u8]` slice:

```rust
    struct JubJubMerkleTreeParamsFp5;

    impl Config for JubJubMerkleTreeParamsFp5 {
        type Leaf = Fp5;

        type LeafDigest = <LeafH as CRHScheme>::Output;
        type LeafInnerDigestConverter = ByteDigestConverter<Self::LeafDigest>;
        type InnerDigest = <CompressH as TwoToOneCRHScheme>::Output;

        type LeafHash = CHROverField<Fp5>;
        type TwoToOneHash = CompressH;
    }
```

## Conclusion

In this a first Succinct Argument from The Book has been implemented.
As always the implementation has been made extremely generic over
everything and turned out quite good I believe. Thank you for reading
and stay tuned for the future posts!

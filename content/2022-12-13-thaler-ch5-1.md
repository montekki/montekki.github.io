The protocols we've taken a look so far are the Interactive Proofs.
A Fiat-Shamir Transformation offers a way to turn any such protocol
into a non-interactive one. That sounds extremely useful for almost
all real-world scenarios and is worth looking into. But how far can
the boundaries of the implementation generality be pushed?
Let's find out.

<!-- more -->

Let's have a look at the diagram of the Transformation from The Book:

![Fiat-Shamir Transformation](../fiat_shamir_transform.jpg)

Recall what happens in an Interactive Protocol is the message
exchange between the Prover and the Verifier where $\mathcal{P}$
sends some messages to $\mathcal{V}$ and $\mathcal{V}$ replies
with random challenges $r_i$. Also there is an asymmetry to
this exchange: $\mathcal{P}$ sends one message more than
$\mathcal{V}$.

The idea behind the Fiat-Shamir Transformation is that one can
"pre-generate" all the random $r_i$ numbers using the hashing
of the $\mathcal{P}$'s claims and that these numbers are considered
secure enough. By using this sort of hashing $\mathcal{P}$
and $\mathcal{V}$ arrive at the same numbers in the non-interactive
manner.

## But what exactly do we need to hash?

The Books mentions a number of vulnerable implementations of
the Fiat-Shamir transformations that happened mainly due to the
fact that now all important information was hashed leading to critical
vulnerabilities.

I've asked [Justin](https://twitter.com/SuccinctJT) on Discord about
what needs to go into the hashes each round and why and the
answers are worth being saved here otherwise they will disappear
in the abyss of unindexed Discord content:

## Mocking randomness

The Interactive Verifiers need to draw random numbers from some
source of randomness and send them as challenges to the Provers:

```rust
pub fn round<R: Rng>(
    &mut self,
    g_j: univariate::SparsePolynomial<F>,
    rng: &mut R,
) -> Result<VerifierRoundResult<F>, Error> {
    let r_j = F::rand(rng);
```
For instance this is what the `round` of Sum-Check does, drawing
$r_j$ from some generator that implements `Rng`. But when
"Fiat-Shamirizing" the protocol the generator `Rng` is no longer
needed and the $r_j$ results from hashing have to be used.There
are many ways one could think of to do that.

For instance, one could modify the protocol to pre-generate a set of random
numbers of necessary size beforehand and use $i$-th generated
number at round $i$. Then, when "Fiat-Shamirizing" this code
the array of randomly generated values could be substituted with
the derived from hashing one.

Or one could implement the `Rng` trait for some type of non-random
generator that would give out predefined numbers to the user.

But for my previous implementation there exists a least-invasive
way to do this: to create a simple trait that describes generation
of a next random field element `F`:

```rust
pub trait RngF<F> {
    fn draw(&mut self) -> F;
}
```

And implement it for any type that implements `Rng` so it would stack
with existing code nicely:

```rust
impl<F: Field, T: Rng> RngF<F> for T {
    fn draw(&mut self) -> F {
        F::rand(self)
    }
}
```

And if we want to feed pre-generated numbers to any user of this
trait we can do it with a following simple type:

```rust
pub struct RandNums<F> {
    nums: Vec<F>,
    current: usize,
}

impl<F: Field> RandNums<F> {
    fn new(nums: Vec<F>) -> Self {
        Self { nums, current: 0 }
    }
}

impl<F: Copy> RngF<F> for RandNums<F> {
    /// TODO: This will obviously panic when goes off bounds.
    fn draw(&mut self) -> F {
        let res = self.nums[self.current];
        self.current += 1;
        res
    }
}
```

## Going generic

Great, now how can this simple transformation be implemented? By looking
at the Figure above there are several things one can notice:

1. There is hashing happening. Hashing is usually done to bytes.
1. It is opaque to the types of $g_i$, they depend on the protocol and as such in case of Sum-Check $g_i$ may be the univariate polynomials, or in case of Schnorr protocol they may be big numbers.
1. All relevant information such as $\mathcal{P}$ claims and everything
has to go into the hash.

It would make sense to create a top layer of this protocol that
would not know the details of the exact protocol being "Fiat-Shamirized"
that would implement all manipulations and hashing with the serialized
$g_i$ in form of byte vectors.

For that the exact $\mathcal{P}$ and $\mathcal{V}$ can be abstracted
with the following traits:

```rust
pub trait InteractiveProver<F> {
    fn g_1(&mut self) -> Result<Vec<u8>>;
    fn round(&mut self, j: usize, r_j: F) -> Result<Vec<u8>>;
    fn num_rounds(&self) -> usize;
}

pub trait InteractiveVerifier<F: Field, R: RngF<F>> {
    fn round(&mut self, j: usize, g_j: &[u8], rng: &mut R) -> Result<bool>;
}
```

So the idea that $\mathcal{P}$ and $\mathcal{V}$ are exchanging serialized
messages with `round` methods. One thing is that for the first
round of $\mathcal{P}$ a method $g_1$ is needed to reflect
the asymmetry of the protocol ($\mathcal{P}$ sends one more message then
$\mathcal{V}$ does).


And the transcript would be just $\lbrace g_1, \cdots, g_l \rbrace$
in serialized form:

```rust
pub struct FiatShamirTranscript {
    g: Vec<Vec<u8>>,
}
```

Now a Sum-Check protocol implementation can be used as an example
of implementation of the above traits:


```rust
impl<F: Field, P: SumCheckPolynomial<F>> InteractiveProver<F> for sum_check_protocol::Prover<F, P> {
    fn g_1(&mut self) -> Result<Vec<u8>> {
        let mut res = vec![];

        let p: (F, univariate::SparsePolynomial<F>) = (self.c_1(), self.round(F::one(), 0));

        p.serialize_uncompressed(&mut res)?;

        Ok(res)
    }

    fn round(&mut self, j: usize, r_j: F) -> Result<Vec<u8>> {
        let mut res = vec![];

        sum_check_protocol::Prover::round(self, r_j, j).serialize_uncompressed(&mut res)?;

        Ok(res)
    }

    fn num_rounds(&self) -> usize {
        self.num_vars()
    }
}
```

So here on the first step to send message $g_1$ we need to pack
two things on it

1. Prover's claim $C_1$
1. The first univariate polynomial $\mathcal{P}$ sends to the $\mathcal{V}$

And mirroring this logic on the $\mathcal{V}$ side:

```rust
impl<F: Field, R: RngF<F>, P: SumCheckPolynomial<F>> InteractiveVerifier<F, R>
    for sum_check_protocol::Verifier<F, P>
{
    fn round(&mut self, j: usize, g_j: &[u8], rng: &mut R) -> Result<bool> {
        if j == 0 {
            let c_1: (F, univariate::SparsePolynomial<F>) =
                CanonicalDeserialize::deserialize_uncompressed(g_j)?;
            self.set_c_1(c_1.0);
            self.round(c_1.1, rng)?;
            return Ok(true);
        }

        let g_j: univariate::SparsePolynomial<F> =
            CanonicalDeserialize::deserialize_uncompressed(g_j)?;

        match self.round(g_j, rng)? {
            sum_check_protocol::VerifierRoundResult::JthRound(_) => Ok(true),
            sum_check_protocol::VerifierRoundResult::FinalRound(res) => Ok(res),
        }
    }
}
```

In the first round we expect $g_1$ to be byte-serialized tuple
$(C_1, g_1(X_1))$.

## Generating and Verifying the Fiat-Shamir Transcript

Now, the random numbers $r_i$ need to be generated from the above
transcript by hashing the first $i$ of them at round $i$. Thankfully
the current tip of `arkworks` library contains very useful utilities
for that, namely a trait `HashToField` that would do exactly what we
need here. With that the implementation of verification for the
above verifier trait would look as follows:

```rust
pub fn verify_transcript<
    F: Field,
    V: InteractiveVerifier<F, RandNums<F>>,
    H: HashToField<F>>
(
    transcript: FiatShamirTranscript,
    verifier: V,
) -> Result<bool> {
    let mut verifier = verifier;
    let hasher = H::new(&[]);
    let mut hash_input = vec![];

    for j in 0..transcript.g.len() {
        hash_input.extend_from_slice(&transcript.g[j]);
        let r_j = hasher.hash_to_field(&hash_input, 1)[0];

        if !verifier.round(j, &transcript.g[j], &mut RandNums::new(vec![r_j]))? {
            return Ok(false);
        }
    }

    Ok(true)
}
```

As you may see here the logic is pretty straightforward: each
round the context of `HashToField` is extended with a new
byte slice of $g_i$. Then it is used to generate the new random
$r_i$ that is fed into the `InteractiveVerifier`.

## Testing the Transformation

To test the Transformation it is suggested to cannibalize the
randomized test from the original Sum-Check implementation:

```rust
#[test]
fn it_works() {
    use sha2::Sha256;
    let rng = &mut test_rng();
    for n in 2..10 {
        let g = rand_poly::<_, Fp5>(n, 3, rng);
        let prover = Prover::new(g.clone());
        let verifier = Verifier::new(n, Some(g));

        let transcript =
            generate_transcript::<_, _, DefaultFieldHasher<Sha256>>(prover).unwrap();

        assert!(
            verify_transcript::<_, _, DefaultFieldHasher<Sha256>>(transcript, verifier)
                .unwrap()
        )
    }
}
```

## Conclusion

We have experimented with generalizing the Fiat-Shamir transformation.
So far the code I've seen implemented in production does not bother
with such complications and instead of being generic over everything
just hashes an array of concrete inputs. But experimenting with
writing generic and expandable code is always fun. Probably the above
approach quite generic to be used for almost any IOP one could imagine.
A fun exercise for the reader would be to use this implementation to
"fiat-shamirize", say, the Schnorr protocol. As usual, the implementation
is available [in the repo](https://github.com/montekki/thaler-study/tree/master/fiat-shamir).
